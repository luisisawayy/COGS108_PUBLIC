## Assesing the statistical relationship between Alcohol Consumption and Homicide Rates in the United States

This study was conducted as a final project for COGS 108 - Data Science in Practice at UCSD, Winter 2025.

Our study aimed to assess the relationship between per capita alcohol consumption (liters per human consumption) and homicide rate accross the 50 states in America from 1985 to 2016. 

The United States is a nation that is heavily driven by alcoholic consumption. Whether it be at a Fourth of July party or New Year's Eve, it wouldn't be abnormal to see groups of friends enjoying a glass of alcohol together. However, what implications does this high consumption of alcohol have on American society? With the prevalent issue of homicide across the United States, does alcohol have any role in this at all? We decided to explore this relationship through various statistics and data science methods, such as scatter plots and correlation matrices. Through this investigation, we found a weak, but prevalant relationship between both variables and thus, some kind of correlation between both factors. In this project we conduct our data analysis in step by step by procedure, providing a structured report of our final analysis and findings.
