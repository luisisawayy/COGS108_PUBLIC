    "Alcohol consumption has often been viewed as a potential factor when considering violent crime rates in America, specifically homicides. Our topic revolves around the relationship between per capita alcohol intake and homicide rate per 100,000 residents across US states from the years 1985-2016. By performing data analysis over multiple decades, our goal through this project is to understand possible correlations between alcoholic consumption and homicide rates over the years, accounting for variations across the 50 states of America. Understanding this relationship could help provide more insight into the role of alcohol in crime dynamics and give a more detailed analysis of whether risky behaviors such as alcohol consumption and homicides rates are linked together or if they have some form of positive association. Throughout this project, we will use exploratory data analysis, inference, and regression models to help us come to strong conclusions that can provide an answer to our research question in this project. In the following paragraphs, we will explain some of the prior work already done related to alcoholism and homicide rates and the relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the National Institute Of Health, alcoholic consumption and binge drinking have increased significantly over the last 10-15 years since the early 2000s. 1 According to their research, the annual increase in alcoholic consumption has been about 0.30%. NIH have also suggested an increase in alcohol related mortality rates. 1 The increase in alcohol consumption lays the platform perfectly for us to conduct research on it's potential association and impact on homicide rates. While NIH's research only studies the increase in alcohol consumption since the 2000s, 1 it provides some background for us to work with and will allow us to make early predictions as we work on our project. Our project will encompass a much larger time frame (1985-2016) and give a larger overview of alcoholism trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "While alcohol consumption is a crucial factor in our study, understanding homicide rate trends is equally important. We also need to focus on homicide rates per 100,000 residents. According to the Council On Criminal Justice, homicide rates have fluctutated since the 1980s. While there was a decline in the early 1980s, there was a sharp increase in the early 1990s, followed by a steady decline until the early 2000s, after which the homicide rates peaked again in the 2010s. 2 Homicide rates have fluctutated a lot, suggesting that homicide rates have a complex set of dynamics driving the changes 2 Our project will try to understand the role alcohol has in the changes of homicide rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond just understanding the changes of rates, prior research regarding the relationship between alcohol policies and violent crime provide a more solid base for us to work on. According to Christopher Carpenter and Carlos Dobkin, professors at UCI and UCSC, the sudden changes of national alcohol sale policies historically have resulted in significant increases in violent crime, especially homicide. 3 Their research suggests potential relationships between alcohol consumption and homicide rates because policies that would have increased alcohol access could have potentially increased consumption. 3 Carpenter and Dobkin's research aligns with our project’s goal of examining the long-term relationship between alcohol consumption and homicide rates across different states. While their research focused on policy changes, our project will aim to expand on their research by exploring trends and relationships over multiple decades (1985-2016) and analyzing state-by-state variations, and try to discover some of the relationships between alcohol consumption and homicide rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the homicide and alcoholism rates and the relationship discussed by the Council on Criminal Justice, NIH and the prior research we explored considered the United States as a whole, providing an overview of trends and the potential relationships at the national level. However, our project will focus on the specifics of each individual state, providing a more focused approach which will allow us to build on all the prior work done by evaluating the relationship between per capita alcoholic consumption and homicide rates per 100,000 residents on a much more granular level. Our project will allow us to analyze and compare the differences in the relationship from state to state. Analyzing from state to state opens up the possibility for us to answer more follow up questions. For example, after our research is completed, we can also answer the question of what kind of geographical patterns do we see in the relationship between per capita alcohol consumption and homicide rates per 100,000 residents ? Is there a stronger or weaker association in certain states ?\n",

    "We predict that there will be a positive correlation between per capita alcohol consumption and homicide rates per 100,000 residents across the U.S. states from 1985 to 2016. We predict this because both alcohol consumption and homicide are, in our view, behaviors associated with negative or risky actions. Moreover, since some people’s bad behavior tends to arise under the influence of alcohol (I.E. they get in fights or car crashes from DUI), it is not far-fetched to assume that per capita alcohol consumption and homicide rates per 100,000 residents might correlate."

    "'''Dataset Purpose: The purpose of the 50 datasets is to give us information about the homicide rates per 100,000 residents in each state from\n",
    "1985-2016. We mentioned above that each of the 50 datasets has 385 variables and 4 observations. 384 variables comes from the fact that the \n",
    "datasets for each state has the homicide rates per month per 100,000 residents. Hence, for 12 months, and 32 years from 1985-2016, we have a\n",
    "total of 384 variables. Each month and year is a variable, or a column in the dataset. In each month and year, we have the homicide rate per 100,000\n",
    "which is a float64 datatype. The last variable is the \"series\" variable which essentially categorizes the data by location and type of metric. For example, \n",
    "for Alabama, we have 4 obervations for series column:  Alabama, Alabama Clearances, United States, and United States Clearances. We will focus on just \"Alabama\", because that \n",
    "obervation represents the entirety of homicide rates per 100,000 residents in that specific month and year. We will do the same process for all the other states. \n",
    "In terms of data cleaning, tidying, and wrangling, we will first combine the 50 datasets into 1. Working with all 50 datasets will be painful, hence from each database, \n",
    "we will extract the required information and make a new database. Specifically, from each database, we will need to just extract the one observation (state name) that has the homicide rate per\n",
    "100,000 by state and not state clearances, US clearances, or US. From here, we will have a \"U.S .State\" column for better clarity and we will also\n",
    "sort the dataframe we create by the U.S. State Name. The U.S. State Name will be a categorical variable. We will make sure that we don't have any NaN values. If we have\n",
    "NaN values, then we simply did not get a homicide rate per 100,000 from the FBI for that month/year. We replace that NaN value with zero. We don't have to worry \n",
    "about the time frame being incorrect because the source where we collected our data from, the FBI Crime Data Explorer, allowed us to extract data based on time requirements'''\n",

    "There is a lot to consider when it comes to data science ethics for this report. For instance, out group have already begun looking for data on homicide rates across the U.S. Some of these datasets include victim names, something that would easily be considered a severe violation of privacy. In order to keep all of our data anonymous, our team will ensure to delete any data that would directly show any personal information about these victims, such as their names. We don't want to include anyone's real name in this study as it is both unnecessary and completely inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For potential biases in these datasets, there definitely may be some factors that may influence the reliability of our exploration. For example, we must ensure that none of our datasets were created by alcohol companies as they may try and diminish the alcoholism and addiction issues across the United States for their own profit. We will aim to collect data from reliable sources, such as research studies and official reports from American police departments. We also want to make sure that all of the data is even spread, essentially meaning that the amount of data we have to represent each state is even. If some states have more data than others, then it throw off our whole project and make our conclusions down the road very inaccurate. To avoid this, we plan on finding an appropriate, even amount of data that would fairly represent each state. On top of all of this, both alcohol consumption and homicide may be a sensitive topic to a lot of people, which is completely understandable. Throughout the project, we will aim to be careful with how we phrase certain ideas and our choice of vocabulary, for instance, ensuring and making it very clear that alcoholism, addiction, and homicide are severe issues that impact a lot of families across the country."
